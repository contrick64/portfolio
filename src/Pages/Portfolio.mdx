# Hand-Coded React Portfolio

[https://github.com/Contrick64/portfolio](https://github.com/Contrick64/portfolio)


This website is all about **recursion**. It was a hard lesson, but it was
well-learned. The site is built on a **<abbr title="YAML Ain't Markup Language">
YAML</abbr>** config file that describes the nested navigation list you see here.

I wrote a function to go through the data recursively, giving everything
a unique ID and other tweaks to make it a useful state, then renders it
using a recursive component.

The site then uses **<abbr title="Markdown with JSX">.MDX</abbr>** files to
render each project page, which allows for easy editing without limiting
customizability to just vanilla markdown.

## Challenges

My biggest challenge was dynamically loading .MDX files into the
```<Layout>``` component based on the path. I used React Router to use the
path in my component, and then lazy-loaded the corresponding .MDX file.
